# About Me
Hi! My name is Patricia Wier and I currently live in Shanghai, China. I am originally from Houston, Texas. I have studied and lived in Shanghai for 2 years, Prague for a semester, and New York for a semester. I am a senior at NYU Shanghai and my major is Interactive Media and Business. I feel I have a stronger grasp of the Business side of my major but I am also interested in expanding my skills more into the interactive media side. Some of my general interests include film, the power of media, women, politics, understanding the minds of others through debate, socially responsible business practices, and personal growth.

Academically, I have taken an array of business classes and film classes with a touch of what I consider tech classes. Some of my favorite classes include Gender and Technology in Media, Intro to Marketing, and Beyond Nature. Outside of the classroom, I was a journalist with the PragueCast and an assistant at Nancy Bishop Casting. As a senior, I am currently on an adventure trying to find what career path to take after graduation.

I would say my strongest concrete skills would be my argumentative writing skills. I feel very confident in my ability to write a solid research paper. I consider myself very good at research in general, and being able to analyze and condense that research. I also consider myself very good at arguing/debating in general.
